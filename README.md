# Kotlin Tutorials

I am interested in Kotlin, as I would like to develop Android Apps for my Galaxy Tab. Although the courses I have learnt so far don't give me the knowledge to do so, an example by Alex Dobinca showed me what the minimum requirements were. In previous Java tutorials, I learnt the importance of Java docs, but found Kotlin lacking in this area. I also found that the more I added to the Kotlin environment, the longer it took to compile and felt that I had not had the same experience with Rust. Rust compile times appear to be much faster.

## Android Requirements

 - When I Installed Android Studio on my Linux Machine I quickly ran out of space and the 4GB or RAM took hours to load the emulator.
 - Using Windows Hyper-V and a Linux environment, Android Studio could not run the emulator.
 - I finally got the example working on a Windows machine with 16GB of RAM using Android Studio. The memory usage went up to 12GB of RAM.
