# Alex Dobinca - Kotlin Tutorials

[Learn Kotlin Programming â€“ Full Course for Beginners](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EExSSotojVI)

## Course Work

 - I found the course easy to follow, as Alex does a good job explaining each example.
 - I was suprised like Alex was that the .dropWhile() function did not operate as expected.
 - As I was not able to find a function like javadocs or rust's cargo doc, I created a comments object in a file of it's own to serve as hints for each example.
 - Where I was unable to contain classes or interfaces within each excercise class, I created a Classes and Interfaces file for them.
 - Altogether, my knowledge of Java and Kotlin were enhanced by this course.
